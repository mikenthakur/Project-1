# 🍽️ Khaja Sathi – A Food Delivery Web App

Khaja Sathi is a custom-built web-based food delivery platform tailored for a single restaurant to directly reach customers without relying on third-party aggregators. This app simplifies food ordering, allows real-time tracking, supports secure digital payments, and enhances restaurant control over menu and customer relationships.


## 📝 Project Overview

Traditional food delivery services in Nepal charge restaurants high commissions and reduce direct engagement with customers. **Khaja Sathi** solves this by offering a standalone, in-house delivery solution that:

- Eliminates third-party commission fees
- Strengthens brand control and customer loyalty
- Improves profitability and communication

> Developed using Agile methodology with iterative sprints, stakeholder feedback, and a focus on quality assurance.
